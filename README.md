The virtual machines used in this project are the following:
- Windows 10 with Sysmon installed (Client machine)
- Ubuntu 22.04 (Wazuh and TheHive)

## Methodology 

### Step 1: Install Windows 10 Virtual Machine

The first step is downloading a virtual machine platform such as VirtualBox or VMWare. In this project, VirtualBox is used as a platform.

Once VirtualBox is downloaded, the next step is to download the ISO image for Windows 10. To do this, download the ISO file from the official Microsoft website.

As shown above, click "Download Now" under "Create Windows 10 installation media". Once it is downloaded, click on the downloaded file where you are required to agree to the license agreement and you will be presented with two options: "Upgrade this PC now" and "Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC". Select the second option which is to create installation media for another PC. 

You will be asked which media to choose whether it is a USB flash drive or ISO file. Since Windows is being installed on the VM, choose ISO file. You can save the ISO file in your preferred directory on your PC. 

The next step is to go to VirtualBox, click "New". Select the name for your virtual machine and the directory where you want to save your virtual machine files. For the ISO Image, select "Other", and go to the directory where you saved the Windows ISO file and choose that ISO file as the image:

As shown above, click skip unattended installation so that you can set up the virtual machine manually. 

For the system's settings, allocate 4GB of RAM and 2 CPUs to the Windows virtual machine. The reason for this allocation is that the performance of the virtual machine is dependent on the PC that runs it. In other words, the virtual machine rely of the PC's specifications. 

Once the mandatory settings and configuration are done, you can finish the setup and run the virtual machine. 

To run the virtual machine, click start. As it is running, you will need to complete the Windows 10 setup. It will ask you for a product key but if you don't have one, you can select "I don't have a product key". You will then be asked which Windows 10 operating system you want to install, select Windows 10 Pro. Accept the terms and conditions, then choose "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)" as the installation type. Select the driver you want to install the Windows on and click next. This will install Windows 10 as a virtual machine.

### Step 2: Install Sysmon on Windows 10 VM

The next step is to download Sysmon on the Windows 10 virtual machine. To do this, go to the Sysmon page on the Microsoft website and click "Download Sysmon". Once it is downloaded, extract the zip file. However, don't click on anything yet.

To obtain the configuraiton file for Sysmon, go to this page https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/tree/master
Click the sysmonconfig.xml file at the bottom of the repository. Once you are on the page, click raw at the top right corner. On the raw page, right-click and save as. Ensure that the config file is on the same directory as the extracted Symon files. 

The next is to open Powershell and run as administrator. Once you are on Powershell, change the directory to the same directory as the extracted Sysmon files using the following command:
cd "C:\Users\chera\Downloads\Sysmon"

Type in "dir" on the Powershell and you can see which files are in directory:

To check how to install Sysmon on the virtual machine, type ".\Sysmon64.exe" on Powershell and that will show you how to install it:

The next step is to install Sysmon (64 bit) using the following command:
.\Sysmon64.exe -i "C:\Users\chera\Downloads\Sysmon\sysmonconfig.xml"

To check if Sysmon is installed on the mvirtual machine, go to start, search for "Services", open the application, and scroll to see if Sysmon is installed.

As shown above, Sysmon is successfully installed. 

## Step 3: Install Ubuntu Virtual Machine for Wazuh
